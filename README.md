### PIT-miniProject
University project of Medialogy students of 5th semester at AUU

# Goal
The goal was to create a VR experience where we could explore a new way of moving around in 3D space - moving  around like swimming in water. Also we wanted some kind of objective in the game, The task became to take pictures of various colourful fish with a waterproof tablet.

# Gameplay
The focus of the project was on creating an uncommon locomotion system in VR. We began with the idea of a swimming game, which meant we had to be able to not only move on the x and z-axis, but the y-axis as well.

Another feature is the underwater camera. We thought the concept of the game could be to take pictures of different fish. The camera’s point of view is slightly in front of it to simulate a realistic camera.

Finally, to make sure the camera isn’t lost to the user, we created a slot for the camera that follows the body of the user. This way they can swim around without having to hold the camera at the same time.

# How to install and run
The game was made for the Quest 2 VR headset. If you are to install the project from the Github page, please note that the Unity version is 2022.3.9f1, and so running it with other versions of unity is not optimal. Downloading the project from github should also include all the relevant packages but, just in case, the most important vr-related are:
* XR interaction toolkit
* XR plugin management
* OpenXR plugin
From there, you can build the project onto the headset using VR-link.
You can also chose to build the project on your computer as an apk, and then upload it via. Tools such as “Sidequest”
